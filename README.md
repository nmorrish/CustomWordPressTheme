# CustomWordPressTheme
I wanted to build a custom WordPress theme to familiarise myself with the inner workings of WordPress. I succeeded in that regard. This is a fully functional scratch-built custom WordPress theme. Dring the course of production, one of the things I learned is that the frequent updates released by WordPress may require periodic updates to the theme. 

Since I have no plans for continued updates to this theme at this time, development has been put on hold for now.

Child themes seem to be the best route to take for custom themes you don't want to update yourself.

To install, create a new folder called "Custom WordPress Theme" under ./wp-content/themes/ in your server directory. Add all the files in this project to that folder.
